# What Makes a Food Retailer App Successful

## Data:

At our disposal an event log. Each log entry is a user action or an event:

- `EventName` — event name;
- `DeviceIDHash` — unique user identifier;
- `EventTimestamp` — event time;
- `ExpId` — experiment number: 246 and 247 are the control groups, 248 is the test group.

## Goal:

The ultimate goal stated for the project is, based on the log data, to determine how users reach the purchase stage and make coclusions on the results of an A/A/B test which aimed to determine a more successful font set.

## Libraries used:
