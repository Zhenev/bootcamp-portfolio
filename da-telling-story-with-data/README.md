# What Makes a Robot-Run Cafe Chain Successful

## Data:

We will use open-source data aggregated in the `rest_data` table:

- `object_name` — establishment name
- `chain` — chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)
- `object_type` — establishment type
- `address` — address
- `number` — number of seats
 
## Goal:

The ultimate goal stated for the project is, based on the open-source data on restaurants in LA, to hypothesize on a potentially successful scaling strategy for a robot-run cafe chain.

## Libraries used:

pandas | 
matplotlib.pyplot |
scipy.stats |
seaborn |
math |
re |
datetime |
cufflinks |
plotly |

NOTE: make sure the Jupyter Notebook is trusted to see the interactive plots.
