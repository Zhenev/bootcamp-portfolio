# Telling a Story with Tableau

## Data:

After gathering the requirements, we asked the data engineers to create an aggregate table `trending_by_time` and store it in `data-analyst-youtube-data` database:

- `record_id` — primary key;
- `region` — country/geographical region;
- `trending_date` — date and time;
- `category_title` — the video category;
- `videos_count` - the number of videos in the trending section.

## Goal:

The ultimate goal stated for the project is to automate the reporting on trending videos of different categories.

## Tools used:
