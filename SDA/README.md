# What Sells a Car

## Data:

- `price`
- `model_year`
- `model`
- `condition`
- `cylinders`
- `fuel` — gas, diesel, etc.
- `odometer` — the vehicle's mileage when the ad was published
- `transmission`
- `paint_color`
- `is_4wd` — whether the vehicle has 4-wheel drive (Boolean type)
- `date_posted` — the date the ad was published
- `days_listed` — from publication to removal

## Goal:

The ultimate goal stated for the project is to determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle; thus, we are going to reveal sound assumptions with regard to cars' characteristics which have the most impact the price of a particular vehicle.

## Libraries used:

pandas | 
matplotlib.pyplot |
scipy.stats
